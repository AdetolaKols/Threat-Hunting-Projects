<img width="740" height="1110" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/175e509e-a948-4788-8507-5e7c0d30ce74" />

## Executive Summary

This investigation confirmed that the compromise of the **AZUKI-SL** administrator workstation on *19 November 2025* was not routine activity, but a coordinated intrusion that leveraged valid credentials, trusted Windows components, and staged automation.

The threat hunt uncovered a structured, multi-phase operation that followed a clear attack lifecycle:

- **Initial foothold** gained through successful RDP authentication using a compromised account.  
- **System and network reconnaissance** conducted through native utilities disguised as normal troubleshooting.  
- **Defense evasion** via Microsoft Defender tampering, file-extension and folder exclusions, and the creation of a hidden staging directory.  
- **Persistent access** established through a scheduled task masquerading as a system update and a secondary administrator-level account.  
- **Credential access** achieved using a renamed Mimikatz binary targeting LSASS memory.  
- **Data staging and exfiltration** carried out inside a concealed ProgramData folder and uploaded over HTTPS to a Discord webhook.  
- **Anti-forensics activity** including targeted clearing of the Security event log to obscure the attacker’s trail.

This activity demonstrates a deliberate compromise aimed at harvesting credentials, staging sensitive files, and moving deeper into the network. All relevant indicators are listed in the **IoCs** section of this report.

## 🔧 Remediation & Hardening Plan

### **Long-Term (1–3 Months)**

- Remove public RDP exposure; enforce MFA and protected admin access.
- Move admin activities onto Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs).
- Begin transition to password-less or FIDO2 for privileged users.
- Enable LSASS protection, Credential Guard, and strict Defender Tamper Protection.
- Apply network segmentation for admin hosts and sensitive systems.
- Deploy full EDR telemetry: PowerShell, AMSI, script block logging.
- Implement egress filtering to block Discord, Pastebin, file-sharing platforms.
- Centralize logs in a tamper-proof SIEM with long-term retention.
- Apply least-privilege access for sensitive data and restrict ZIP/archiving in ProgramData/Temp.
- Roll out security awareness for admins on script abuse, LOLBins, and suspicious RDP use.

---

### **Detection Engineering (Ongoing)**

- Detect misuse of LOLBins (certutil, curl, cmdkey, schtasks).
- Alert on Defender exclusion changes (file, folder, process).
- Monitor for PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` and unsigned script execution.
- Refine monitoring rules to alert on creation of hidden ProgramData folders, Temp-based execution, new local admin accounts or priviledge changes
- Flag ZIP/archiving events in non-standard directories.
- Alert on outbound HTTPS uploads to non-business services.
- Watch for attempts to clear logs (e.g., `wevtutil cl Security`).
- Perform regular red/purple-team exercises to test resilience.
---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- RDP without MFA exposes organizations to high-risk credential compromise.
- LOLBins and renamed binaries make detection harder; deep telemetry is essential.
- Defender exclusions can quietly weaken protection for months if not monitored.
- Scheduled tasks and local accounts remain high-value persistence vectors.
- Strong logging, segmentation, and privileged identity controls reduce long-term risk.
