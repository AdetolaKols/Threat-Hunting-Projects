<img width="1362" height="912" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb01c41d-1334-49df-9b27-379b7c511988" />


## Case Summary
A password spray attack against an internet-exposed RDP endpoint resulted in a successful remote logon On *2025-09-16*. After authenticating, the intruder executed a masqueraded binary, created a scheduled task to establish persistence, and weakened Microsoft Defender by adding a folder exclusion. The actor performed host discovery, locally archived data, and communicated with external infrastructure before attempting to exfiltrate data over HTTP to a nonstandard port. All identifiable indicators (source IPs, account names, file paths, and other IoCs) are documented separately in the **IoCs** section of this report.

On *2025-09-16*, the cloud host **flare** was compromised via an external RDP login from a Public IP using the account **slflare**. Shortly after gaining access, the attacker executed a staged PowerShell payload, dropped a masqueraded binary, and established persistence by creating a scheduled task and adding a Defender exclusion for `C:\Windows\Temp`.
